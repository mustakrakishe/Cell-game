# Cell game

## Introduction
This is a simple two players-game based on HTML and pure JavaScript.
So you can run it in your browser without the Internet connection. =)

## Game rule
The field is a grid 10x10. Each cell contains  a random not repeated point. Red cell adds point to your score, blue - subtracts it.

The first player can choose any cell in the field. Then players altermate select cell by cell with only limit:
- Player 1 can use only rows;
- Player 2 can use only columns.

The first player who has got 300 points wins.
